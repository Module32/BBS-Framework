## About the BBS Framework
The BBS Framework is a simple template created by the devs of Bot Building Site. It was created in order to make developers' lives much easier as well as ship bots to clients at a faster rate.

**The concept behind the BBS Framework is really simple-- essentially, it's a huge project with all the files and modules developers might need.** This includes things like a music module, moderation module, fun one, utility one, etc. etc.. Whenever a client requests a bot, we copy all the modules we need into our working bot directory. With a bit of customization and configuration, ta-da! We have ourselves a finished bot for our client!

## What the BBS Framework will mean for clients
With the BBS Framework, clients will see a big surplus of benefits that come with it. A few of these include:
- Much faster development time
- More features
- Less buggy software (as the framework will have already been tested)
- More consistent design in your bot

However, as with any software, it's important to recognize some of the cons. The BBS Framework will change a few things our previous clients may have liked, including:
- More personal and customized bots
- A unique design theme for their bot

We hope that this new concept will be well-received both in our client community as well as our developer team. Thanks a ton for supporting BBS and its endeavors. We can't wait to bring even more changes to improve the experience for everyone.
